# DeFi Explorer

Work in progress, the new DeFi Explorer built on [DeFi Jellyfish](https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish).

## Developing & Contributing

Thanks for contributing, appreciate all the help we can get. Feel free to make a pull-request, we will guide you along
the way to make it merge-able. Here are some of our documented [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
